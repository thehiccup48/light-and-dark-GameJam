# Ghost in the machinery

This is my submission for the NullPTR light and dark GameJam.

I was unable to complete the game within the time limit as I started 2 weeks late but I will still continue to work on the game until it is finished.

Unfortunately the day before submission time a catastrophic failure occured in the scene loading scripts so I am having to rebuild them from scratch. 
Meaning the game is currently unplayable. However it should be fixed by the end of the week if not sooner.

About the game:

Ghost in the machinery (title work in progress), is a 2D platformer game where you play as a ghost exploring a high-tech temple. 
In your exploration you aquire a lantern you can use to turn the machinery on and off. The machinery includes the platforms, enemies, doors and lights(tying this all back to the main theme).
Ghost in the machinery (title work in progress) is also an "open world" game in a similar way to hollow knight just with a much smaller world.

Later in the game you will be able to unlock 2 new abilities. the first will fix all the broken doors throughout the game allowing you to access a "boss fight"
where you will then unlock the ability to temporarily become immune to damage allowing you to bypass some spike walls to complete the game.
