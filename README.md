# light-and-dark-GameJam

this is my submition for the NullPTR light and dark GameJam.

I was unable to complete the game within the timelimit as i started 2 weeks late but i will still continue to work on the game untill it is finished.

unfortunately the day before submition time a catastrophic failure occured in the scene loading scripts so i ame having to rebiuld them from scrach. 
Meaning the game is curently unplayable. However it should be fixed by the end of the week if not sooner.

About the game:

Ghost in the machinery (title work in progress), is a 2D platformer game where you play as a ghost exploring a high-tech temple. 
In your exploration you aquire a lantern you can use to turn the machinery on and off. the machinery includes the platforms, enemies, doors and lights(tying this all back to the main theme).
Ghost in the machinery (title work in progress) is also an "open world" game in a similar way to hollow knight just with a much smaller world. the world map is included in the world map folder.

Later in the game you will be able to unlock 2 new abilities. the first will fix all the broken doors threwout the game allowing you to acess a "boss fight"
where you will then unlock the ability to temperarily become immune to damage allowing you to bypass some some spike walls to complete the game.
